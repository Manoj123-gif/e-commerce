                              <p class="fs-montserrat">No one likes to think about their shiny new gadget going kaput,
                                 but it's essential to understand the warranty coverage that comes with it. Typically, 
                                 gadgets come with a <b>manufacturer's warranty</b> , which covers any manufacturing defects 
                                 for a specified period (usually 1 year). Some brands even offer an <b>extended warranty</b>  
                                 for an additional cost, which can provide extra peace of mind. Here's what to consider:</p>
                              <br>
                              <ul class="fs-montserrat points">
                                <li><p><b>Warranty Duration:</b> Check the length of the warranty and weather it's worth extending.</p></li><br>
                                <li><p><b>Warranty coverage:</b>  Be aware of what's covered under warranty and what's not (e.g., physical damage).</p></li><br>
                                <li><p><b>Authorized service centers:</b> Make sure there's a service centre near you to avoid any hassles in case of issues.</p></li>
                              </ul>
                              <br>
