                     <p class="fs-montserrat">Most laptops come with one of three operating systems: <i class="blue">Windows</i> , <i class="blue">ChromeOS</i> 
                        , or macOS (for MacBooks only). </p>

                    <br>
                    <p class="fs-montserrat">The most flexible operating system, Windows 10, runs 
                        on more laptop models than <i class="blue">Chrome</i>  OS or macOS. Windows notebooks 
                        range in price from under $150 to several thousand dollars and offer a 
                        wide array of features from touch screens to fingerprint readers to dual 
                        graphics chips. Windows 11, the latest version of Microsoft's flagship operating system, 
                        provides a number of improvements over Windows 10, including the revised interface, 
                        the new <i class="blue"> Microsoft Store</i>, handy features like Snap View.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="fs-montserrat">Since its launch in October 2021, Windows 10 has also added a 
                        host of improvements, including <i class="blue">Focus Sessions</i>  and a Do Not Disturb mode. 
                        The 22H2 update also came with notable performance and battery optimization 
                        enhancements. Windows 11 laptops are great for students, researchers, and business 
                        users, and they're still the only <i class="blue">gaming laptops</i>  anyone should consider</p>

                    <p class="fs-montserrat">All MacBooks come with Apple's latest desktop operating system, <i class="blue">macOS Sonoma</i>  . 
                      Overall, the operating system offers similar functionality to Windows 11, but with a different take on 
                      the interface that substitutes an apps dock at the bottom of the screen for Microsoft's Start menu and 
                      taskbar. Instead of the Cortana digital assistant, Mac users get <i class="blue">Siri</i> . They can also perform transactions 
                      with <i class="blue">Apple Pay</i> , take calls or texts from their phones, and unlock their laptops with an <i class="blue">Apple Watch</i> .</p>
                      <br>
                    <p class="fs-montserrat">However, macOS isn't made for touch, because no 
                      MacBook comes with a touch screen. While Apple did bring iPad apps to its 
                      laptops starting with <i class="blue">macOS Big Sur</i>   (iPad and <i class="blue">iPadOS</i>  apps can run natively 
                      on M1, M2, and M3 Macs), you have to rely on a touchpad or mouse to navigate them. 
                      macOS Ventura brought Apple's Stage Manager for handling multitasking, which is an upgrade, 
                      but much more difficult to master than Windows solution.</p>

                      but the primary focus is still the Chrome browser. All modern Chromebooks, 
                      like the <i class="blue">Lenovo IdeaPad Duet 5 Chromebook</i>  can <i class="blue">run Android apps</i> , but they aren't

                      experience and are more functional <i class="blue">than most tablets</i> . If you <i class="blue">need a Chromebook</i> , 
                      look for one with at least 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage if this is a secondary 
                      laptop, if it's a primary laptop we'd recommend 8GB of RAM and an SSD rather than eMMC flash 
                      memory. A screen with a 1920 x 1080 resolution is preferred and you can now find <i class="blue">4K</i>  and OLED models

                      2-in-1s generally come in two different styles: detachables with screens 
                      that come off the keyboard entirely and convertible laptops with hinges that 
                      bend back 360 degrees to change modes.</p>

                        also known as Full HD or 1080p. Higher-end laptops have screens that are 2560 x 1600, 3200 x 1800, 
                        or even 3840 x 2160 (4K), which all look sharp but consume more power, lowering your battery life.</p> 
                        <br>
                       <p class="fs-montserrat">Display quality is about much more than resolution. 
                        IPS panels range in color and brightness, so read our reviews to find out if the 
                        laptop you're considering has a good display. We typically look for a DCI-P3 
                        color rating of over 85% and brightness great than 300 nits. If you want the very
                        best picture quality consider an <i class="blue">OLED display</i>  or <i class="blue">miniLED</i> , but read reviews of these models 
                        carefully as there can be battery trade-offs. </p>

                       <p class="fs-montserrat"><b>Touch Screen:</b>  If you're buying a regular clamshell laptop, rather 
                        than a 2-in-1, you won't get much <i class="blue">benefit from a touch screen</i>  and you will 
                        get 1 to 2 hours less battery life. On 2-in-1s, touch screens come standard. 
                        If you still want a touch screen, check out our <i class="blue">best touch screen laptops </i>page .</p>

                        <p class="fs-montserrat"><b>Graphics Chip:</b>  If you're not playing PC games, creating 3D objects 
                          or doing high-res video editing, an integrated graphics chip (one that shares system memory)
                          will be fine, especially Intel's Iris Xe graphics. If you have any of the above needs, though, 
                          a discrete graphics processor from Nvidia or AMD is essential. </p>
                          <br>
                         <p class="fs-montserrat">As with CPUs, there are both high- and low-end graphics chips. Low-end gaming or 
                          workstation systems today usually have Nvidia GTX RTX A1000 or RTX 3050 Ti GPUs while mid-range models 
                          have RTX 4050 or RTX 4050 Ti and high-end models have RTX 4070 or above chips. <i class="blue">Nvidia maintains a list</i>  of 
                          its graphics chips from low to high end.</p> 
                          <br>
                        <p class="fs-montserrat">Nvidia's rivals, AMD, launched the Radeon RX 7000 GPUs at CES in January of 2023. 
                         <i class="blue">AMD also keeps a list</i>  of its graphics cards.</p>
                         <br>
                         <p class="fs-montserrat"><b>Ports:</b> While the absence of ports is usually not a deal-breaker when 
                          choosing a laptop, it's helpful to get the connections you need right on the 
                          system, rather than having to carry a slew of dongles. However, many 
                          mainstream laptops now only offer USB Type-C, Thunderbolt 4, or USB4 ports that 
                          are USB Type-C compatible. Having legacy USB 3.0 ports, an audio jack, 
                          an SD card reader, and HDMI can be useful, but depending on the type of laptop 
                          you are considering these features are growing harder to find.</p>
                          <br>
                         <p class="fs-montserrat">With that said, USB Type-C is a definite plus because you can use it to 
                          connect to <i class="blue">USB Type-C hubs</i>  or <i class="blue">docking stations</i>  that can give you any combination of 
                          ports you might need.</p> 
                          <div><img src="image/l-12.png" alt=""></div>
                          <p class="fs-montserrat"><b>Connectivity:</b> If you need to use your laptop on the go, consider 
                             buying a <i class="blue">4G LTE laptop</i>  or <i class="blue">5G laptop</i> . You'll have to pay for a data subscription plan,
                             but this will allow you to access the internet away from a router. If you want a laptop 
                             with the latest and greatest connectivity options, Wi-Fi 7 is it. However, Wi-Fi 6e is 
                             still excellent and far more common. Keep in mind that you also need a Wi-Fi 6e or Wi-Fi 7 
                             router in order to actually enjoy the benefits of that performance boost.</p>
                             <br>
                             <p class="fs-montserrat">We also suggest looking for a laptop with Bluetooth 5.3, the latest 
                              standard that offers improved connectivity with Bluetooth-enabled devices, like mice and 
                              headphones.</p>
                              <br>
                          <p class="fs-montserrat"><b>DVD / Blu-ray Drives:</b>If you love physical media times are 
                            tough in the laptop world for you. Optical drives are virtually
                             entirely gone, because all software and movies are downloadable, 
                             we continue to track down <i class="blue">laptops with DVD drives</i> , but it's a challenge these 
                             days. If you really need to read/write discs we strongly recommend leaving this 
                             off the wish list for your laptop and buying an  <i class="blue">external DVD drive</i> .</p>

                              <p class="fs-montserrat">If you're buying a large, bulky notebook or 
                                a gaming rig that you'll use only on a desk near an outlet, you don't have to 
                                worry about battery life. However, if you plan to use the laptop on the go, you'll 
                                want at least 8 hours of endurance, with 10+ hours being ideal. To determine a 
                                notebook's expected battery life, don't take the manufacturer's word for it. Instead, 
                                read third-party results from objective sources, such as our reviews.</p>

                                    you can budget more, you'll get a system with better build quality, stronger performance

                                    <li><p><b>$150 to $250:</b> The least-expensive notebooks are either Chromebooks, which run

                                       respectable specs. However, there are sure to be some trade-offs to hit that price. 
                                       There are outliers like the Lenovo IdeaPad Duet 5 Chromebook or the <i class="blue">Samsung Galaxy Book</i> .</p></li>

                                        more portable, more powerful or both. Expect higher-resolution screens, 
                                        faster processors, and possibly discrete graphics. The lightest, 
                                        longest-lasting ultraportables, like the <i class="blue">MacBook Air M3</i>  or <i class="blue">Asus Zenbook 14 OLED (2024)</i> ,
